Hello, my name is Yuriy Belyakov and it's nice to meet you!

When I was studying at university I experienced freelancing for the first time. I have been addicted to it ever since then.

I was a single developer on a small project and a team leader on a huge project.

I have a wife and a couple kids!

**About this blog**

My aim for this blog is to express myself and share my knowledge with other developers.

There are a few subjects I'm interested in:

- PHP
- Golang
- Docker (docker is rule the World)
- Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
- Software Architecture
- JavaScript (very small, Vue.js mostly)
- Project Management
- Reading Books

I hope that you enjoy reading my blog!
