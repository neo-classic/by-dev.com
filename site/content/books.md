I read  tons of books and I still buying paper books mostly, but with times I started to collect classical books for programmers, which won't die with years or die, but not in a couple months. For others, I have an e-book.

So in this list will be only my favorite books, which I would recommend to read every programmer. Other books will be in articles.
